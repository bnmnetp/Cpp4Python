Welcome to *C++ for Python Programmers*. This short ebook is an ongoing
project to help Computer Science students who have had one or two
semesters of Python learn the C++ programming language. If you are not
a part of that audience you may still find this a useful way to learn
about C++. This book is written using the build on what you know
philosophy. In order to help you learn C++ I will start with a Python
example and then implement the example in C++. Along the way we will
examine the strengths, weaknesses and differences between those two
languages.
